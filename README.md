# Steps Followed: 
1. Preprocessing the text data, removing stop words, punctuation.
2. Creating bag of words and apply TF-IDF vectorization on the features.
3. Training the following machine learning models:
  - Decision trees
  - Random forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-nearest neighbors
  - Support vector machines
4. Evaluating each model using the following metrics:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 score
  - Confusion matrix
  - ROC-AUC curve
